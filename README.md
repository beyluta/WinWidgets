<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

**WinWidgets** makes web-based desktop widgets easy to develop. Using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` create your own Windows 11 widgets on the fly.

This is what makes this project interesting:

- 🧰 Focus on creating your widgets with all the usual web tools to your disposal
- 👆 Develop complex widgets using a high-level programming language (JS)
- 🖱️ Develop your widgets from anywhere then simply drag and drop to easily port it over
- ⌨️ Have better control over your widget's window with built-in front-end tags

If you want to make your own installers for distribution: There is a script called `SETUP.iss` to help package the Software as an installer.

- Visual Studio Community 2022 (or equivalent)
- InnoSetup (Optional - for generating the installer)
