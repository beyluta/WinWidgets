<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

WinWidgets offers the possibility to create desktop widgets using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for your Windows 10 or Windows 11 machine.

This is what makes this project interesting:

- 🧰 Focus on creating your widgets with all the usual web tools to your disposal
- 👆 Develop complex widgets using a high-level programming language (JS)
- 🖱️ Develop your widgets from anywhere then simply drag and drop to easily port it over
- ⌨️ Have better control over your widget's window with built-in front-end tags

## Download
